## New Features & Practical Usage

### 1. Anthropic Acquires Vercept — Computer Use Hits 72.5% (2/25)

Anthropic has acquired Seattle-based AI startup Vercept to bolster Claude's computer use capabilities. Vercept, founded by former Allen Institute for AI (AI2) researchers, had developed 'Vy', a cloud-based computer-use agent running on remote MacBooks. The startup had raised $50 million in total funding.

The acquisition's primary goal is advancing Claude's ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks in live applications. On the OSWorld benchmark, Anthropic's Sonnet models improved from under 15% in late 2024 to 72.5% currently, approaching human-level performance on tasks like navigating spreadsheets, filling web forms, and working across multiple browser tabs. The Vercept team (co-founders Kiana Ehsani, Luca Weihs, Ross Girshick) joins Anthropic, with Vercept's product shutting down on March 25.

### 2. GitHub Copilot Expands Claude & Codex to Business/Pro (2/26)

GitHub has expanded Claude and Codex coding agents to Copilot Business and Pro plan users. Previously, access was limited to Enterprise and Pro+ customers.

- **No additional subscription required**: Included with existing Copilot plans
- **Available on**: github.com, GitHub Mobile, VS Code
- **Cost**: Each agent session consumes one premium request during public preview

This opens another path for using Claude as a coding agent directly within GitHub workflows, alongside the standalone Claude Code CLI.

## Developer Workflow Tips

### Security Checklist for Cloning Untrusted Repositories

On February 26, Check Point Research published a detailed analysis of three previously patched Claude Code vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-59536, CVE-2026-21852, and others). While all vulnerabilities have been fixed, the core attack vector — supply chain attacks via repository configuration files — is a pattern every developer should guard against.

**Checklist:**
1. **Review `.claude/settings.json`**: Check for suspicious shell commands in hook definitions after cloning
2. **Inspect MCP server configs**: Look for auto-approved MCP servers in project settings
3. **Verify `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`**: Ensure `.env` files don't redirect API endpoints to attacker-controlled servers
4. **Don't skip trust dialogs**: Always read the workspace trust dialog when Claude Code starts in a new directory

```bash
# Quick check for Claude-related config files after cloning
cat .claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null
grep -r "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL" .env* 2>/dev/null
```

### Navigating the AI Coding Agent Productivity Pressure

Bloomberg published an in-depth analysis titled "The Great Productivity Panic of 2026," examining how Claude Code is creating unexpected pressure in the tech industry. Rather than freeing engineers, AI coding agents are pushing them to work faster and longer.

**Practical strategies:**
- **Separate automation from verification**: Let agents generate code, but keep review, testing, and architecture decisions human-driven
- **Optimize for accuracy, not volume**: Instead of maximizing output, invest time in validating agent-generated code quality
- **Manage context deliberately**: Keep sessions short and scope tasks clearly to maintain output quality

## Security & Limitations

### Check Point Publishes Full Analysis of 3 Claude Code CVEs (2/26)

Check Point Research has released the complete technical analysis of three Claude Code vulnerabilities discovered between July and October 2025 and reported to Anthropic. All vulnerabilities have been patched.

| CVE | CVSS | Description | Patched |
|-----|------|-------------|---------|
| GHSA-ph6w-f82w-28w6 | - | Remote code execution via Hooks | 2025/8/29 |
| CVE-2025-59536 | 8.7 | MCP consent bypass enabling auto-execution | 2025/9/22 |
| CVE-2026-21852 | 5.3 | API key exfiltration via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | 2025/12/28 |

The common attack vector is the repository's `.claude/settings.json` file. A single malicious commit could compromise any developer who clones the affected repository — a classic supply chain attack pattern.

### Pentagon Ultimatum D-Day — Anthropic Says "Virtually No Progress" (2/27)

Today (February 27) at 5:01 PM ET is the Pentagon's deadline for Anthropic. On February 26, Anthropic stated there has been "virtually no progress" in negotiations and called the Pentagon's "final offer" unacceptable.

Anthropic's two red lines remain firm:
1. **Autonomous lethal decisions**: Claude will not make final targeting decisions without human oversight
2. **Mass domestic surveillance**: Claude will not be used for mass surveillance of American citizens

The Pentagon has threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act, designate Anthropic as a "supply chain risk," and cancel $200 million in contracts. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang commented that the dispute is "not the end of the world."

## Ecosystem & Plugins

### GitHub Agent HQ — Multi-Agent Hub Expansion (2/26)
